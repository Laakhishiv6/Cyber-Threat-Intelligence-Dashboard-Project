# Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-Dashboard-Project

Welcome to the CyberTheat Intelligence Dashboard we application! This is a simple web application designed to simulate threat analysis, provide insights into potential vulnerabilities, Its main goal is to help users understand how vulnerabilities are documented, analyzed, and managed in cybersecurity.  While it is not connected to real-world data and is rather a static analysis, the app serves as a learning tool for anyone interested in cybersecurity concepts such as threat identification, severity assessment, and user interaction with threat intelligence platforms. 


Features

- Threat Prediction: Get threat severity predictions.
- User Feedback: Users can leave feedback and rate their experience.
- Search Functionality: Search for threats using keywords.
- Download Data: Export the CVE data as a CSV file.

Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python 
- Flask (Python web framework)
- Git (for version control)
- Heroku CLI (if you plan to deploy the app)

Implementation

in VS code create the following files:
 app.py (Flask)
 index.html
 login.html
 threat_details.html

 Download CVE's from github of any choice you wish to . A CVE is a document used to identify and catalog publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

 In the following files copy the codes from the repository and paste it . 
 now type the following commands in the terminal of vs code 
 -> pip install virtualenv
 ->virtualenv env 
 ->.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
 ->pip install flask

 Now download the following dependencies :
 pip install requests

 Now run the app.py program and locate to the ip address provided in the terminal 

 Aditionally you can deploy the web application in Heroku :)
